# Raspberry Pi Games
During COVID19, my children and I have designed and programmed games.  We used a [Rasberry Pi 3](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASPBERRYPI3-MODB-1GB-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01N13X8V1/)
and a [SenseHat](https://www.amazon.com/RASPBERRY-PI-RASPBERRYPI-SENSEHAT-Raspberry-Orientation-Temperature/dp/B014HDG74S/) to create simple games that help us stay sane!
  
<p>This package has a few games:
  
* *basher.py* - Use the Sense Hat's gyroscope to move the white ball to 'get' the fruit. Get all 10 fruit, and you win!
* *snake_games.py* - Use the Sense Hat's joystick to move the snake to eat as much food as fast as you can in 30 seconds.
* *marble_maze.py* - Use the Sense Hat's gyroscope to move the white ball through the labyrinth. When you reach the exit, you win.
  
<p>Each of the games can be run independently. Alternatively - 'main.py' acts as a wrapper
  
* *main.py* - Using the Sense Hat's joystick, this program acts as an interface for users to select their game.
